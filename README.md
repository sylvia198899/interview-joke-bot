## Joke Bot Service

This is a joke bot service, which has the following functions.

1. When any new message comes in and contains the phrase 'tell me a joke', the joke bot service will reply a random joke to the conversation.
2. Two buttons, 'Tell me a joke!' and 'Funny!' are following the random joke to return back to the conversation as well.
3. User can click 'Tell me a joke!' button to get more jokes, or choose the 'Funny!' button to end it.
