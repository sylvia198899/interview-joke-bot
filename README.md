## Joke Bot Service

This is a joke bot service, which has the following functions.

1. When any new message comes in and contains the phrase 'tell me a joke,' the joke bot service will reply a random joke to the conversation.
2. Two buttons, 'Tell me a joke!' and 'Funny!' are following the random joke to return to the conversation as well.
3. Users can click 'Tell me a joke!' button to get more jokes or choose the 'Funny!' button to stop getting more jokes.

I used ngrok and https://drift.me/leeyin to test this service.
